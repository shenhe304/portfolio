                    <p>This project was a collaborative effort involving a team of four: a director, writer, engineer, and designer. I was responsible for color settings, component design, style guide creation, and designing both the homepage and subpages. Despite having only a two-month production period, we successfully launched the site and delivered it to other departments.</p>
