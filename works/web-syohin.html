                <p>The official website design for the launch of a new service in my previous company. In order to address instances of defamation on social media and to initiate a legal service for handling issues such as unpaid rent, a new official website is required.</p>

                <h2 class="c-title-lv2">GOAL</h2>
                <p>I have taken on the responsibility of designing a new website as a new service is being launched, marking a departure from the unchanged lineup of core services over the past few years. Given that the department responsible for web updates lacks expertise in web design, I opted for creating it on WordPress. It was essential to design each block with simplicity and versatility in mind.</p>
                <p>The goal was to convey the range of services offered in a clear and straightforward manner to the users. Additionally, for the web updating team, particularly those less familiar with web design, I aimed to create a design that clearly indicates which design to use for each block in a simple and understandable way.</p>
                <p>To guide users on where to click and what to focus on, I maintained a unified color scheme to ensure that users' attention remains focused without distractions.</p>

                <h2 class="c-title-lv2">TEAM WORK</h2>
                <p>We formed a four-person team comprising a web director, web writer, engineer, and myself to create our website. <br>The structure was overseen by the director, with the writer handling the text, the engineer handling the coding, and myself in charge of the design.</p>
                <p>Given the extensive verification processes inherent in the legal industry, we managed to complete the website launch within a tight 2-month timeframe.</p>
