                <h2 class="c-title-lv2">The differences compared to Japanese design</h2>
                <p>In Japan, the legal industry tends to have a higher volume of text, including explanations and annotations, which is aimed at preventing misunderstandings and complaints. In designing, I take into consideration the placement of text, spacing, and readability across various devices to ensure that the text doesn't appear overwhelming.</p>
                <p>In English-speaking websites, emphasis is placed on a stylish appearance, and the amount of text is generally less compared to Japan. In actual creation, I find that there is greater freedom in design. Accordingly, I pay close attention to user eye movement, ease of clicking, and other factors to enhance user experience.</p>
