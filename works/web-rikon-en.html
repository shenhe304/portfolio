                    <p>In Canada, unlike Japan, there are no specific colors associated with genders. Therefore, I chose colors based on their meanings and references from competitors, as there is no conventional association of colors with gender in the Canadian context.</p>

                    <p>These are keywords related to "law firm" that are searched on Google.It is evident that in addition to expertise and achievements, there is an emphasis on personality traits such as communication skills and approachability.</p>

                    <p>This web page is for advertising purposes, so it will be displayed on the screens of people who are researching divorce or lawyers. Therefore, I chose blue tones that convey a sense of expertise and reliability at a glance. Additionally, blue colors can express feelings of loneliness and solitude, making it a perfect match for individuals struggling with divorce who are looking for a trustworthy lawyer.</p>

                    <p>By choosing a calm tone of navy within the blue spectrum, it was intended to enhance a sense of calmness and trust.

                <div class="p-details-wrap__item">
                    <p>In Japan, there is a greater amount of text, including annotations, to prevent complaints and unnecessary troubles. When I looked at the websites of some Canadian law firms,  there was less text. This allows customers to find the necessary information quickly.</p>
                    <p>I believe these differences stem from cultural distinctions between customers and service providers. In Japan, there is a culture of expecting high-quality service, and detailed information and explanations are considered essential to prevent unnecessary complaints. </p>
                    <p>Considering the amount of text, UI design was also taken into account in Japan.</p>
                    <p>This experience will be valuable when working in Canada, providing insights into adapting to different cultural expectations, especially in terms of communication and information presentation.</p>
