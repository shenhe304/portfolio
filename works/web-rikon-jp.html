                    <p>In Japan, law firms are often perceived as having a high threshold, and there is a desire to encourage people to feel more comfortable seeking consultations. With the theme of "approachability" in mind, brainstorming was conducted. The keyword "Sakura" (cherry blossoms) emerged from this process.  I would like to explain the significance of Sakura for the Japanese.</p>
