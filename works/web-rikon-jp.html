                <p>As emerged in the brainstorming session, there is still an association in Japan between warm colors like red and pink and the concept of femininity. Let me explain the historical background behind this perception.</p>

                <h3 class="c-title-lv2">Examples of shades within the pink spectrum being used include</h3>
                <p>As of 2024, in Japan, the association of women with the color pink is commonly observed in various aspects, such as clothing, products, and advertising.</p>

                <p>Due to this history, there is still a tendency in Japan to associate warm colors like red and pink with women.</p>

                <h3 class="c-title-lv2">For the Japanese, cherry blossoms hold significant cultural importance.</h3>
                <p>In Japan, law firms are often perceived as having a high threshold, and there is a desire to encourage people to feel more comfortable seeking consultations. With the theme of "approachability" in mind, brainstorming was conducted. The keyword "sakura" (cherry blossoms) emerged from this process. I would like to explain the significance of sakura for the Japanese.</p>

                <p>The marketing research results indicate that 'empathy' is crucial for the consumption behavior of Japanese women. The following is a survey conducted by one of the major newspaper companies, The Asahi Shimbun. It inquired about the impressions of advertisements published in the newspaper and the attitude changes, such as purchase intent, after viewing those advertisements.</p>
