                <h2 class="c-title-lv2">The differences compared to Japanese design</h2>
                <p>In the project in Japan, the design was constrained due to the unique requirement of handing over the website to another department. Despite these limitations, I collaborated with the director and met the requirements of other departments to create a user-friendly site.</p>
                <p> For the English site, I opted for a completely different design from the Japanese version. The site uses only two colors, with the intention of emphasizing specific areas in red, making it clear that the services go beyond debt consolidation. This design choice allowed for a distinct visual identity.</p>
